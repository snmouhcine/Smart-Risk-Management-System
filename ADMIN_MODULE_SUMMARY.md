## What Was Created

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/add_user_roles_and_admin.sql`)

- **subscription_plans** table: Manages subscription tiers (Gratuit, Basique, Pro)
- **payments** table: Records all payment transactions
- Role-based access control with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Automatic profile creation on user signup
- Functions for updating statistics and checking admin status

### 2. Admin Components
