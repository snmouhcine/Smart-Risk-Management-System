# Fix Stripe Payment Redirect

## Problem
After payment, users aren't redirected to the app automatically and subscription status isn't updated.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated PaymentSuccess Component
The `/payment-success` page now:
- Automatically updates the user's subscription status to `true`
- Shows loading state while updating
- Redirects to the app after 2 seconds
- Handles errors gracefully

### 2. Configure Your Stripe Payment Link

Go to your Stripe Dashboard and edit your Payment Link:

1. **Login to Stripe**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links
2. **Edit your Payment Link**
3. **In "After payment" section**, set:
   - Success URL: `http://localhost:5173/payment-success`
   - Cancel URL: `http://localhost:5173/app`

### 3. How It Works Now

1. User clicks "Souscrire maintenant"
2. Redirected to Stripe Payment Link
3. After successful payment â†’ Redirected to `/payment-success`
4. PaymentSuccess component:
   - Updates `is_subscribed` to `true` in database
   - Shows success message
   - Redirects to `/app` after 2 seconds
5. User can now access the app!

## Testing

1. Create a new user account
2. Try to access `/app` - you'll see payment required
3. Click "Souscrire maintenant"
4. Complete payment with test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
5. You'll be redirected to success page
6. After 2 seconds, you'll be in the app!

## Note

This is a temporary solution until Stripe webhooks are set up. In production:
- Use webhooks for secure payment verification
- Add subscription expiry dates
- Handle subscription cancellations
